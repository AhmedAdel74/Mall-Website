        <h1 >3D Cinema</h1>
        <h3 >What is 3D cinema?</h3><br>
        
        <p class="db410">    3D films have existed in some form since 1915, but had been largely relegated to a niche in the motion picture industry because of the costly hardware and processes required to produce and display a 3D film, and the lack of a standardized format for all segments of the entertainment business. Nonetheless, 3D films were prominently featured in the 1950s in American cinema, and later experienced a worldwide resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s driven by IMAX high-end theaters and Disney-themed venues. 3D films became increasingly successful throughout the 2000s, peaking with the success of 3D presentations of Avatar in December 2009, after which 3D films again decreased in popularity.[1] Certain directors have also taken more experimental approaches to 3D filmmaking, most notably celebrated auteur Jean-Luc Godard in his film 3X3D.</p><br><br>
        
        
        <h3>Cinema Tickets...</h3><br>
        
        <h4>1st class:</h4>
        <p class="db410">
        VIP packages let you offer attendees the exact experience they’re looking for, at the exact price they’re willing to pay. Premium ticket tiers can help you attract new attendees — and make more money from your current audience. If you have the resources to provide this premium experience, this is the second most important ticket type for driving revenue after GA.
        </p>
        <h4>2nd class:</h4>
        <p class="db410">
        If your event is seated, you can let attendees pick where they want to sit. Reserved seating tickets are also a simple upgrade that can provide big value for attendees wanting to be closer to a performer or speaker at your event.
        </p>
        <h4>3rd class:</h4>
        <p class="db410">
        The most common of ticket types is used by almost every event for the bulk of their admissions. This ticket type provides admission to your event without any extras. GA tickets are typically on sale the longest, and usually one of the least expensive of all tickets you offer.

        <h1>Traditional Cinema</h1>
        <h3>What is Traditional Cinema?</h3><br>
        
        <p class="db410">A movie theater (American English), cinema (British English), or cinema hall (Indian English), also known as a picture house, the pictures, or the movies, is a building that contains auditoria for viewing films (also called movies) for entertainment. Most, but not all, theaters are commercial operations catering to the general public, who attend by purchasing a ticket. Some movie theaters, however, are operated by non-profit organizations or societies that charge members a membership fee to view films.</p><br><br>
