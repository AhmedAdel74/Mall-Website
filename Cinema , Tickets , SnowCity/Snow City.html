        <h1 class="db510" >Ice Rinks</h1>
        <h3 class="db530">What is ice rink?</h3><br>
        <p class="db420">An ice rink (or ice skating rink) is a frozen body of water or hardened chemicals where people can ice skate or play winter sports.Besides recreational ice skating, some of its uses include ice hockey, bandy, rink bandy, ringette, broomball, speed skating, figure skating, ice stock sport and curling as well as exhibitions, contests and ice shows.There are two types of rinks in prevalent use today.</p><br><br>
        <h3 class="db530">Types of ice rinks...</h3><br>
        
        <h4 class="db540">Natural ice:</h4>
        <p class="db420">Many ice rinks consist of, or are found on, open bodies of water such as lakes, ponds, canals, and sometimes rivers; these can only be used in the winter in climates where the surface would freeze thickly enough to support human weight. Rinks can also be made in cold climates by enclosing a level area of ground, filling it with water, and letting it freeze. Snow may even be packed to use as a containment material.</p>
        <h4 class="db540">Artificial ice:</h4>
        <p class="db420">In any climate, an arena ice surface can be installed in a properly built space. This consists of a bed of sand or occasionally a slab of concrete, through (or on top of) which pipes run. The pipes carry a chilled fluid (usually either a salt brine or water with antifreeze, or in the case of smaller rinks, refrigerant) which can lower the temperature of the slab so that water placed atop will freeze. This method is known as 'artificial ice' to differentiate from ice rinks made by simply freezing water in a cold climate, indoors or outdoors, although both types are of frozen water. A more proper technical term is 'mechanically frozen' ice.<br><br>
        A famous example of this type of rink is the outdoor rink at Rockefeller Center in New York.</p>
        <h4 class="db540">Synthetic:</h4>
        <p class="db420">Synthetic rinks are constructed from a solid polymer material designed for skating using normal metal-bladed ice skates. High density polyethelene (HDPE) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW) are the only materials that offer reasonable skating characteristics, with UHMW synthetic rinks offering the most ice-like skating but also being the most expensive. A typical synthetic rink will consist of many panels of thin surface material assembled on top of a sturdy, level and smooth sub-floor (anything from concrete to wood or even dirt or grass) to create a large skating area.</p><br><br>
